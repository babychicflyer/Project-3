This is the cornerGrocer project from my class  I am still working on it. and I am very excited to. It is supposed to store and report frequencies of items in the input file  
What did you do particularly well?
  I think the one the one thing I can do well is read what I am writing and understanding most of it on my own  Now with tutors help they're telling me that they're impressed for some reason. I guess I know how to listen and follow and code the way I am being taught to. Zybooks is nice and all but can only do so much explaining. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I need to make sure I immerse myself more and more into the coding world. I am very unfamiliar with most of these platforms and most or the applications of them and the building ones as well. I need to learn the jargon and the ways of this career I am wanting to start. I only wish I had a mentor to help me.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 
The option 3 is the most challenging. I still cannot figure out how to get it to display the item and the quantity.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The tracking of files was very much needed to learn and I am still going to keep learning to be able to create classes and better formatting of my own code. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Its a very small program. I could have made it more managable by putting it into sperate files for each option but I am still learning how to do that and I am completely confident that I will be able to do so in the near future.
